I love illustration, writing, crafting and board games, and I'd love to be able to work in projects related to any of those fields, or even, better, be able to combine tem to offer unique results that are customized for the specific needs of this person or project.

I also believe that it's possible to better oneself every day - that's why I am always attending trainings and conferences that makes me grow as a professional and as a person.

If you like my work, you can visit my online shop. You may find something that you like - else, I can always craft it! :-)
